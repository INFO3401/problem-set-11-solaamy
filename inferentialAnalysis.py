#The factor of gender relatively appears to contribute most heavily to admission. Since the p-value is closed to 0.1 but it still doesn't have significant relation to admission. I don't think the admission process is biased. First, the gender factor and other factors don't appear to have a significant correlation with Admission. Also, from the data of percentage of admitted, these data didn't appear to have a big difference between gender and department. So I think the admission process is biased.

#From the visualization of the number of people admitted by departments, we can see from A department to F department, number of people admitted is decreased. Department A, B and D admitted more men than women while department C, E and F admitted more women than men.
#From the visualization of the numebr of people rejected by departments, we can see from department F rejected the number of people the most. It is interesting to see though department A admitted more men, it rejected more men than women as well.
